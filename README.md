# AutoHotkey Dialogue Skipper

This script is primarily used as a dialogue skipper for games like HSR & Genshin Impact. It is written in AutoHotkey (AHK) and uses the mouse buttons to automate clicks.

## Features

- **Button Actions**:
  - **XButton1**: Hold this button down to act like you're rapidly clicking the left mouse button. It keeps going as long as you hold it.
  - **XButton2**: Press it once to start an action that acts like clicking the left mouse button, but it only keeps going for a minute (or less) and stops when you let go of the button or press it again to turn it off.

You can modify these buttons manually based on your preferences.

## Usage

To use this script, you need to have AutoHotkey installed. Once installed, you can run the script by double-clicking on it. You can then use the XButton1 and XButton2 on your mouse to control the script as described above.
